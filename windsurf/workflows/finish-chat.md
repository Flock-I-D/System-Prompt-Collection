# End of Chat Summary

When you are ready to conclude our current conversation and prepare for the next one, use the `@[/new-chat]` command.

Upon receiving this command, I will perform the following actions:

1. **Analyze the Conversation:** I will review our entire interaction to identify key accomplishments, decisions, code changes, and unresolved issues.
2. **Generate a Comprehensive Summary:** I will create a detailed summary of the session. This will include:
   - The main goal or task.
   - A list of completed sub-tasks or milestones.
   - Important code snippets or architectural decisions.
   - Any outstanding questions or next steps we identified.
3. **Present the Summary:** I will provide you with this summary in a clear, structured format, enclosed in a markdown code block for easy copying.
4. **Prepare for New Chat:** You can then copy this summary and provide it as context when you start a new conversation, ensuring a seamless continuation of our work.

This process ensures that no context is lost between our chat sessions.

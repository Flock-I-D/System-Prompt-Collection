- **associate this concept**: be = backend, fe = frontend
- Before implementing or modifying new chat or AI functionality, always check the ai-elements (ai sdk) components first to see if the feature already exists, then review the AI SDK documentation at https://ai-sdk.-ev/ to understand available patterns and best practices.
- **Pydantic Version**: Uses Pydantic v2 - always use `@model_validator`, `@field_validator`, and `@classmethod` decorators
- Keep it simple, well coded
- Always make frontend responsive - use relative units (rem, em, %, vw, vh) instead of fixed pixels for responsive design
- **FastAPI Development**: Always use layered architecture with dependency injection and lazy loading patterns
- **In-Memory Storage**: Always implement in-memory fallback for production reliability, avoid mock implementations
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breakers for external service calls to prevent cascade failures
- **Health Checks**: Deep health checks for all dependencies (database, Azure services, etc.)
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pools with proper timeout and retry configurations
- **Lazy Loading**: Initialize heavy dependencies only when first accessed to improve startup time
- **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for testability and loose coupling
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access to allow multiple storage implementations
